%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The unidentified virus pneumonia was discovered in December 2019, and the virus was officially named COVID-19 in January 2020. Until now, the outbreak has caused more than 7 million Confirmed cases and 400, 000 Confirmed deaths worldwide.[1] \\
Then in this poster I will be investigating in whether the death ratio of COVID—19 is related to individual characteristics (such as age group, gender).

    The course will cover the following steps
		\begin{enumerate}
\item HYPOTHESIS MODEL
(General Linear Model)
\item TEST THE MODEL
(to find out which is more associated with mortality)
(Logistic Regression)
(Reference data(i.e.\ AIC \& P value \& confidence interval...))
\item ANALYSIS OF SOME GRAPHICS(Mosaic plot \& ggplot2)
\item LINEAR MODEL(between death ratio and age by linear regression)
\item CONCLUSIONS \& INFORMATION
\item THE ERROR ANALYSIS
\end{enumerate}
I will cut and paste various bits of \LaTeX \  from the coursenotes and use some plots and datas from Google to produce this poster.

Use the data1 ''COVID19\_open\_line\_list''.[2]
\\ Variables: death (death 1, alive 0), age, sex
{\bf Set model with General Linear Model}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Model1 \     glm(death$\sim$ age)
(the relationship between death and age \ in binomial)
\item Model2 \     glm(death$\sim$ sex)
(the relationship between death and sex\ in binomial)
\item Model3 \     glm(death$\sim$ age+sex)

\includegraphics[width=9.6cm]{e1.png}	
    \includegraphics[width=6.8cm]{e2.png}	
	
	{\bf First Table}
\\
1.Comparing the Confidence interval of Model1 and Model2 (97.5\%), Model1 is very small while Model2 is over 0.5. Meanwhile, the P-value of Model2 is too large , while Model1's AIC is slightly smaller than Model2's AIC. 
\\Therefore, it is preliminarily judged that Model1 is better than Model2.
\\2.According to Model2‘s OR, the mortality rate of male patients is 1.03742574 times that of female patients. 
\\The risk of death in male is slightly higher than that in female.
\\{\bf  Second }{\bf Table }
\\
3.In Model3, AIC is relatively large, the P-value and Confidence Interval (97.5\%) of parameter sexmale are too large to be accepted, we can guess again that the relationship between death and sex is very small.
\\{\bf Inspection }
\\Set 2 models with full and none parameter,then use step function to find out which is more associated with mortality.
The result is same with Model1.So the Model1 is better than others.
\\{\bf SUMMARY(Estimate)} \\ 
Males are more likely to die than females, and Model1 is a better model than the other two.

	{\smaller The results of two data sets are slightly different from some information on the Internet, and the first has a higher child mortality rate than the second group.
\\The second is more consistent with expectations.
\\{\bf Analysis:}
\\1.The Mosaic plot in data1 shows that the death ratio in children is not in the range of acceptance,so it should be questioned. 
\\2.The mortality rate changes with time[1], but these datas end at different time(2/29/2020,6/3/2020).
\\3.Data1 misses many datas, more than 12,000 data were deleted, It may cause errors.}
