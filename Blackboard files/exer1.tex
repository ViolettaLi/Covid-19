Extract from a recent press article:
The scientific world has been astonished by an announcement from 
Dr Tony Strainer, a mathematics lecturer at the
University of Nuneaton, establishing a definite link between
Poincare's h-Cobordism and the price of fish. A partner in this
remarkable work is Mr Bert Wilkins, fishmonger and amateur
algebraic topologist. Explained Dr Strainer: we have
established a proof of Drivle's Theorem when the fish function C 
is finitely-undermined,
via a new form of the Rincewind inequality. Their 
work is due to appear in the Proceedings of the Iceland Cod Fisheries
Society of London, Series D.
Professor Hertz of Gottingen has remarked: this result is
very exciting. We may now be able to show that f(C) is indeed
grease-proof, thus opening the way to a mathematical systematisation
of wet fish.
