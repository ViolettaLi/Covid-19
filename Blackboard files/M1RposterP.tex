``Lies, damn lies and statistics."
-- Mark Twain. \\
Luckily, this course is about probability, so I can leave the lies to the second year lecturers....

Assessment of uncertainty in such real-life problems is a complex
issue which requires a rigorous mathematical treatment.
M1S develops the probability framework in which
questions of practical interest can be posed and resolved.

    The course will cover the following topics
